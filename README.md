# ICT302 Moodle 'onlinetext' Plugin Project

This project is an enhancement of the existing 'onlinetext' assignment submission type.
Key features are the addition of a side panel and additional settings options for instructors to customise the plugin which were added with the objective of enhancing the user experience for both student and instructor.

# Side Panel
The side panel displays all information relating to the assignment submission (assignment name, description, rubric, etc.) in a panel that is essentially added on top of the main online text editor. Interactable button options are displayed at the bottom right of the page and allows for the expansion, collapsing, and half-display of the panel.

Additional settings options (links and examples) are created to allow for a greater range of content to be added to the panel contents. 

# Requirements
* Moodle 4.4+
